# Future Plans

## 🚀 1. **Real-time Anomaly Detection (ML + XAI)**

**Use case:** Detect abnormal temperature, AQI spikes, or sensor faults.

### ML:

* Train an **Isolation Forest**, **Autoencoder**, or **LSTM** on historical time-series data.
* Input: temp, AQI, humidity, PM2.5, etc.
* Output: normal/anomaly + anomaly score.

### XAI:

* Use **SHAP** or **LIME** to explain *why* something is flagged as abnormal.
* Visualize key contributors (e.g., "high PM2.5 + low wind = anomaly").

### UI:

* Show the explanation in a modal or tooltip on each flagged data point.

---

## 🧠 2. **Environment Quality Scoring with ML**

**Use case:** Create a ML model that scores "environmental safety" (0-100) for a location.

### ML:

* Use RandomForest or a regression model on multiple features (temp, PM2.5, AQI, etc.)
* Train on labeled data (can mock via expert rules initially).

### XAI:

* Use SHAP to visualize which features impact score the most per location.

---

## 📈 3. **Forecasting Weather/AQI (Time Series ML)**

**Use case:** Predict next 3 hours of air quality or temperature.

### ML:

* Use **Prophet**, **LSTM**, or **XGBoost** on local time-series data.
* Display predictions in Chart.js with confidence intervals.

---

## 🌍 4. **Geo-Aware ML: Smart Monitoring Suggestions**

**Use case:** ML model suggests which nearby area to monitor based on data volatility.

### ML:

* Cluster regions using **DBSCAN** or **K-Means** based on lat/lon + metric volatility.
* Recommend hotspots (e.g., "This industrial area shows rising AQI").

---

## 🧪 5. **Synthetic Data Generator for Model Training**

**Use case:** You may not have enough labeled data.

### ML:

* Build a small **Generative Model (VAE or GAN)** to simulate realistic environmental data patterns.

---

## 🕵️ 6. **Anomaly Alerting + Explainable Dashboard**

**Bonus Features:**

* Threshold alert system (SMS/email dummy alerts).
* Historical heatmaps (AQI over time).
* Compare multiple cities side-by-side with a ML-driven risk score.
